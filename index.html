            <h1>Hi , Ms.Iara </h1>
            <p> Happy Valentine's Day! hehe , 
                i know you're impatient but bear with me , sh*t this it not me hahaha  
                i hope this finds you well and happy , i don't wanna say it but you already know naman.  
                i honestly like everything i know about you so far , the impatient , your rants ,  
                well sometimes nakakatampo lang you left me unread then nasa ibang platform lang pala ahahaha ,  
                especially the random thing.  We may be limited in time sometimes .
                There's no need to rush things just take our time cause that is part of building trust and loyalty . 
                I always wish you the best thing to happen for you the moment you give the chance.  
                Sana makita mo and ako rin na what we have right now is special .
                And can't wait for you to speak more about what you love to do , 
                the things you hate and things that scare you . You're worthy of love , I know you have a past , 
                I can't fix that but I'll be here to figure things out
            </p>
